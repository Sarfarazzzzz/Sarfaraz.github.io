# Hi, I'm Mohammed Ismail Sarfaraz Shaik 👋

### Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Master's Student @ GWU

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer who operates at the intersection of **statistical analysis** and **software engineering**. I don’t just build models; I build the pipelines that feed them and the systems that deploy them.

Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Data Science** at The George Washington University. Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer at TCS**, designing scalable ETL pipelines and automating workflows for healthcare and finance clients.
